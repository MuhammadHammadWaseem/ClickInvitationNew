            Why to choose an online seating chart for big events
        </h2>
        <p>
            An online seating chart allows you to visually assign the tables and chairs to the guests before the wedding to avoid the mess of crowds standing and fighting for the seats. However, it is not necessary that only you are supposed to assign the seats; guests can also choose their tables and seats according to their preferences.
